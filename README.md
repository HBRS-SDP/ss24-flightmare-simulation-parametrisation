## Introduction
Flightmare Simulator is flexible modular quadrotor simulator.It contain two main components. A configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation
Flightmare comes with several desirable features
(i). A large multi-modal sensor suite,It includes an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene
(ii). An api which can stimulate 100s of drone
(iii). Can be intergrated with virtual-reality headset

## Prerequisites
